                <p class="">
                    I made a brick breaker game using vanilla JS using a canvas element and redrawing every frame with updated positions.
                    <br><br>
                    I hadn't made a game using only JavaScript before, so decided to give myself a little challenge to see what I could do.
                    <br><br>
                    I found some pointers on the internet to get me started and then delved into adding more features like difficulty levels and a few different kinds of power ups and restarting the game.

                <p class="">
                    I ended up having quite a bit of fun making the brick breaker game, so I decided to try my hand at another classic, Snake!

                <h2 class="glitch layers">Quest of Adventures</h2>
                <p class="">
                    I made this for the final part of a Game Design and Development course that I took on coursera.
                    <br><br>
                    I used the Unity Engine along with the C# I had picked up during the course to create this game.
                    <br><br>
                    The project took me about one month, and making a game from the ground up in that timeframe was both fun and challenging.

                <p class="">
                    I made this game when I wanted to see if I could make something that randomly generates its map.
                    <br><br>
                    I decided to go with a text-based game, again using Unity and C#, to start out exploring that concept with a simpler idea.
                    <br><br>
                    I have started working on a more complex random floor generator which I intend to use to make a 2D game in the future.

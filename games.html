                    I made a brickbreaker game using vanilla JS using a canvas element and redrawing every frame with updated positions.

                    I hadn't made a game using only javascript before so decided to give myself a little challenge to see what I could do, found some pointers on the internet to get me started and then delved into adding more features like difficulty levels and a few different kinds of power ups.

                    I ended up having quite a bit of fun making the brickbreaker game so I decided to try my hand at another classic, Snake!

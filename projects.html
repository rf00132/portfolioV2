                <p class="">
                    While starting out learning Japanese, I found that memorising hundreds of Kanji characters was going to be challenging.
                    <br><br>
                    I decided to create an application to create and store and test myself on flash cards. At the time I was using Unity and just decided to go with what I knew.
                    <br><br>
                    It took a while to get the logic working, but we got there in the end, and it's now available for anyone to download on itch.io

                <h2 class="glitch layers">Netmatters Site</h2>
                <p class="">
                    Back in 2021, I was enrolled in a software engineering crash course, called the Scion Coalition Scheme, which is run by the Netmatters.
                    <br><br>
                    One of the projects we were given was to recreate their website as close to the original as possible. This was my first time creating such a complicated webpage to a spec.
                    <br><br>
                    There were definitely some challenges along the way getting the layout and site behaviours to match up to the original, and their website has been redesigned since, but I'm very proud of the result.

                <h2 class="glitch layers">Form Migration Tool</h2>
                <p class="">
                    Since starting at the council, we were aware of an upcoming project, which was estimated to take 18 months with multiple full-time developers, and switch from using two lowcode form platforms to only one. Upon realising both platforms could export forms as JSON, I hatched a cunning plan.
                    <br><br>
                    Using C#, I wrote a tool to take an export from one platform and systematically convert it to a format that could be imported into the other platform. This was no easy task, there were many edge cases to handle and small formatting issues going from one to the other.
                    <br><br>
                    Now it wouldn't do all the work for us, converting conditional logic from one platform to the other was going to take more time to nail than it would save, and we didn't have the time for that.
                    <br><br>
                    In the end, it took one full-time developer and one part-time developer only five months to move over 200 forms, saving us an extra year of licensing for the platform and freed up developers for other projects.
                    <br><br>
                    As a bonus, I was able to take my work from this project. After a couple of days of downtime I was able to hook it up to our "Request a Form for your Service" form. We now use this to get a starting import with all the questions and sections and extra fluff ready to go, really reducing the time people spend developing forms. This is probably the piece of work I am most proud of to date.

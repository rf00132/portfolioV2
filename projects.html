                    While starting out learning Japanese, I found that memorising hundreds of Kanji characters was going to be challenging.
                    <br><br>
                    I decided to create an application to create and store and test myself on flash cards. At the time I was using Unity and just decided to go with what I knew.

                    It took a while to get the logic working, but we got there in the end, and it's now available for anyone to download on itch.io

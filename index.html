            <h2 class="glitch layers">About Me</h2>
            <p class="">
                I am a junior software engineer at West Northants Council, where I mostly work on integrations and service improvements. Typically, I will integrate two pieces of software the council has procured that need to talk to each other, or I am automating tasks that service areas or our team would have been performing manually.
                <br><br>
                I spend most of my free time working on personal projects like games and applications, listening to music or checking out games with interesting elements to see what's happening in the industry at the moment.
                <br><br>
                We have four dogs and a cat back home. I enjoy spending time with them, messing about with the dogs in the garden and taking them out for walks.

            <p class="">A group of British builders operating outside the O.C. I'm sure Egg is a great person. And although the intervention didn't work, it turned into one of the Bluth family's better parties. You can always tell a Milford man. Well, I spent so much time making sweet love on my wife that it's hard to hear anything over the clatter of her breasts.</p>

            <p class="">
                I am a junior software engineer at West Northants Council, where I work on integrations and service improvements. Typically, I integrate systems or automating tasks that people would have been performing manually on top of some support duties.
                <br><br>
                I spend most of my free time working on personal projects like games and applications, listening to music or checking out games with interesting elements to see what's happening in the industry at the moment.
                <br><br>
                I love puzzles and games, have done for as long as I can remember. I'm always looking for new challenges to try and solve. It's this that lead me to do Pure Mathematics at university, and it's this love that eventually had me turn my eye to programming.
                <br><br>
                We have four dogs and a cat back home. There's nothing better than messing about with the dogs in the garden, playing tug or fetch and taking them out for walks.
